## Today
Just today, our YGeeker team officially released the product ClipMemo. I can't help but feel deeply moved. In high school, when we were working in the Youth League Committee to repair the student union's official website, we now have several products. The power of the team is great. Rene, Charles, and I together form the core of this team, and we also cannot do without this team.

## Acquaintance

I first met Rene and YGeeker when I was working in the Youth League Committee in high school. At that time, Rene was already an independent developer, independently developing and operating [YGeeker Toolbox](https://www.ygktool.com/). It was also Rene who led me into front-end development at this time. Rene's progress always amazed me. He started programming much later than me, but he has a super strong learning ability and high efficiency. Within one year after graduation, he made three mobile apps (Balloner, I didn't, ClipMemo) and a game that won the first prize in the province (Rene claimed it was unintentional...).

As a senior in high school, Charles and I were really anxious seeing his progress. During this year, I could only try to squeeze time to practice a little front-end. As for the results... Finally, we also graduated.

## Our YGeeker

This summer vacation, Charles and I officially joined YGeeker. Since then, YGeeker has become the real YGeeker team today. We participated in the internal testing and bug submission of Balloner, and also participated in the planning of I Didn't and ClipMemo.

Due to limited technology, I hardly participated in the development of these mobile apps, but focused on the construction of the official website and media marketing. Soon, our official website, Bilibili, and Douyin accounts will be online, stay tuned!
In the discussion of the latest project (currently in the confidential stage), we also meticulously crafted the details. Late-night meetings have become the norm. Although we are exhausted every time we close the laptop lid, we all have a belief that YGeeker will have a bright future. The YGeeker team will become better because of the efforts of each of us.

## ClipMemo
With the release of Rene's [Xiaohongshu post](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/65098669000000001f00583d), ClipMemo was officially released. In the few days since it was launched and approved, we received subscriptions and payments from two strangers, one of whom is from Switzerland on Earth; we also received affirmation from foreign users, which is undoubtedly an exciting thing for us.

ClipMemo allows you to create card notes based on audio and video, just like writing card notes. With the natural advantages of audio and video, it can effectively help you do many things, such as learning foreign languages, recording the key points of online courses, etc. Its practice materials can be imported from online platforms such as Bilibili and YouTube, or from local sources. It must be a cool thing to import the videos you are interested in for learning.

Unfortunately, we currently only have the energy to maintain the iOS version. Android users, please look forward to it! We have listed other products on Google Playstore, and after the completion of the official website construction, we will provide the installation packages on the official website.

## Finally

Recently, I have been really busy, whether it is the YGeeker project or college life. But in any case, YGeeker will persist. Because we know that we can be strong and we have a promising future.
