This is an article that has been delayed for a long time.

It's another New Year, and I wish everyone a happy New Year's Day in 2024!
This New Year's Day holiday, I originally wanted to spend it in the cinema. There are still many movies I want to watch during the New Year's Day档期, such as the recently super popular "A Love So Beautiful", "The Lighting Store", "Goodbye, My Coke" released some time ago, and the re-screened "My Best Friend's Wedding". Unfortunately, I am in Yibin, and there are very few movies shown in the nearby cinemas. "A Love So Beautiful" is expensive and the tickets are hard to get, and there is only one cinema in the whole city showing "The Lighting Store" and it is super far away. So in the end, I only went to the cinema to watch "My Best Friend's Wedding", and then watched the "Ex" series 1-4 in the dormitory.

## Anxiety

Actually, I have always been a kind of person who is relatively anxious, and it has become more obvious since I went to college. I will think about how to plan the learning progress of various technology stacks during college to ensure that I can learn/basically understand key technology stacks such as frontend, Python, Java, C, etc. before graduation; I will think about whether to go for an internship outside or directly work for YGeeker after graduation; I will think about whether I will be fired due to poor technology after working, and a series of problems due to the fast technological change and the inability to keep up with the speed of technological iteration; I will think about the risks of starting a business at YGeeker; looking at the myriad of lights, I will think about whether there will be a place for me in the future...
Yes, these are not things I should care about at this stage, but I seem to be unable to avoid these topics. Because the competition in the Internet industry has intensified in recent years, I have to think about some things that I will have to face in the future. I am just an ordinary person from an ordinary second-tier college, like the people around me.

## Human World

Because I am an ordinary person, I prefer to watch some movies with the flavor of human life. In recent years, some movies with heroism or some legendary colors are actually difficult to evaluate: too far away and too abstract. It is not difficult to see that the movies I chose above are closer to life, and there is not much psychological burden or ideological struggle when watching them.

"My Best Friend's Wedding" is a re-screened movie, and I watched the premiere in 2021. I heard on Douyin before that the ending would be changed. I knew that the re-screening would not change the ending, but I still had some inexplicable expectations. I wanted the story in the movie to have a perfect ending because life is already imperfect. However, the ending obviously remained the same, but I don't regret going to watch it in the early morning. First of all, I need to state that I have no story with this movie. Going to watch the re-screening should just be an explanation for the passing youth. At two different time nodes, time seems to have become concrete. That day, I touched growth through the movie ticket in my hand.

Watching the "Ex" series of movies was a spur-of-the-moment decision, and it can also be said to be a long-planned one. I always wanted to watch them all in one go before, and finally had the time this time. It is also a story of human life, and it seems to be somewhat similar to YGeeker. By reading other people's stories, can I also gain some experience for myself?

## Commit 2023

In the previous article "[180 Days After the College Entrance Examination: How Are We Doing?](https://gloridust.xyz/%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB/2023/12/04/afterGaokao180day.html)", I have actually talked about almost everything. During the conversation with Rene last night, I thought a lot again. For the rich after-school activities in college, my suggestion is: Students with clear goals in mind should still sit down and do their own things.

And I really didn't learn anything useful this year. I thought I could master JS in one month and basically keep up with the company's React development rhythm in three months this summer, but I almost learned nothing. I am ashamed to say that.

## Look Forward

Don't overestimate yourself. I hope I can learn JS in 2024 and basically be competent for the React decoration work of the company's official website.
I hope I can focus more on my own things next year.
