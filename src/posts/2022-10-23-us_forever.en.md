I can't help but sigh how time flies. It seems like the change of term happened just a few days ago. On that day of the acceptance ceremony last year, Minister Wang [ReneWang](https://Rene.wang) said to me, "One year passes quickly. The last time I stood here seemed like just recently." Yes, one year has passed quickly, and I am standing here again. But this time, I am not the one being appointed, but the one appointing others.

A year ago, with the full trust and high expectations of Minister Wang, I was空降 (air-dropped) to the position of minister. At that time, I had no leadership experience or painting skills, and naturally, I was questioned by many. But fortunately, my members trusted me very much and supported my work arrangements and decisions. I sincerely thank everyone for their trust and support, which conveys the warmth of a collective. Unconsciously, I have already regarded the Propaganda Department as my second home.

When we first met, I was a "social phobia". I was very worried about whether I could get along well with everyone. But fortunately, I got to know everyone soon. Minister Qin was a relatively easy-going person and liked to work in the studio with everyone. Sometimes he was a little lazy, but he loved art (the kind that spams his Qzone). ZYS was more lively, and she and XZL always arrived on time in my impression, took the initiative to clean the workplace, beautify the wall paintings, and worked actively with excellent skills. SZX and XZY were a little careless (they made a mistake in counting the names during the first National Day work evaluation, which was really urgent at that time), but they actually cared about the work in their hearts. For the work arranged later, they completed it on time and in quantity. YHX joined us during the supplementary recruitment. His late addition did not overshadow his excellence. He had strong photography and post-production skills and completed the work seriously and reliably. KWW was a little 任性 (headstrong), but it was not difficult to see her management and leadership ability. She was resolute in doing things and had a strong attitude when expressing her opinions. She showed strong ability in the painting group and also worked actively and meticulously after transferring to the photography group. DMM & XLL were two lovely girls who loved photography. Although they did not work for a long time, I could still feel their love for the photography work.

During this year, the Propaganda Department won all the awards, including the "Best Department" every semester, and I personally also won the title of "Top Ten League Cadres". This is certainly gratifying, and this is our eternal honor. But in fact, I have always believed that what can really affect us "forever" within one year is not any awards, but the gains and growth. Therefore, my original intention for the work of the department is not to receive much praise or rewards, but to hope that the abilities of each member in all aspects can be exercised. Therefore, when assigning some less important tasks, I try to let every member participate and leave the opportunities for training to students with poorer professional skills.

At the same time, the impact of this year's work on me is also immeasurable. I have grown from an introverted and ignorant teenager to a young man with strong ability to handle things, decisive decision-making, judgment, appeal, and leadership. Although this may have cost me a lot of time at work, I have no regrets.
I hope that in the years to come, when we recall the experience of this year, we can still be moved to tears by the fleeting years and not regret meeting each other this year.

The Fifth School Youth League Committee Propaganda Department has achieved us forever. Now that I am leaving, I am filled with tears and don't know what to say.
