## Introduction

After the college entrance examination, everything seems to have returned to normal. Of course, the "post-college entrance examination era" seems to be quite different from the descriptions of the elders in the past and our own fantasies. So, 180 days after the college entrance examination, how are we doing?

## The College Entrance Examination: A Calm Ending

It seemed like an ordinary afternoon. After writing the last word of the English composition, I didn't have much emotional fluctuation. Just like usual, I put down my pen, glanced at the time, and checked whether the candidate information was filled in completely. Then, I honestly stared at the test paper in a daze, silently counting the remaining time.

During the three years of high school, I didn't even work as hard as I did in junior high school. In junior high school, the school put great pressure on me, making me move forward struggling; while in high school, there were relatively fewer influencing factors. Therefore, I didn't put all my energy into the study of the college entrance examination subjects. I didn't want learning to occupy my entire life, and for some reasons, I couldn't fit all the knowledge into my head. But if you ask me if I regret it? My answer is no.

In the three years of junior high school, except for getting to know Brother Hao, I didn't seem to have done anything meaningful. And after the end of the first year of junior high school, Brother Hao also transferred out of the school. In the three years of high school, I had rich after-school time, lived a middle school life, served as the minister of the Propaganda Department in the School Youth League Committee Student Union, accumulated certain management experience, and met many friends; I also met partners like Rene and Charles, who led me into the door of Web development and Hackintosh, and after graduation, we also made many interesting products together, received outsourcing projects, and the upcoming [YGeeker Ltd](https://ygeeker.com).

I put a lot of energy into things other than academic learning, so no matter what the result of the college entrance examination was, I could accept it. Thanks to God's blessing, my college entrance examination score far exceeded my expectations, and I was also admitted to my desired school and entered a major that I could accept.

## After the College Entrance Examination: Unfulfilled Plans

I once imagined spending this only long vacation in my life after the college entrance examination, thinking about working to experience life, traveling to see the world, and also thinking about learning programming languages such as JavaScript. But obviously, plans often change. The third driving test, which I took twice but still failed, greatly changed my plans, and of course, there was also the factor of extremely fragmented time. So I spent this entire summer at home, uneventfully.

Of course, on the day after the college entrance examination, I started my French learning journey. I tried Duolingo, the French Assistant APP, the French Grammar Point-by-Point Pass, and the courses on Bilibili, but so far, the only one I can stick to is Duolingo. Perhaps this is due to its reminder and encouragement system, which has kept me going for 180 days.

After the college entrance examination, we had a lot of time to study, which allowed us to spend more time at work. I personally think that the YGeeker after the college entrance examination is the real YGeeker team, because at this time we are colleagues working together towards the same goal.

## University: Quite Different but Not Disappointing

University life is much freer than high school, but compared to the imagination, it is still quite different.
The university I imagined, I could accept a little more courses, and then we still had a little more time to study the direction we were interested in. But the reality is that there are various mandatory activities to participate in every day. As the publicity committee member of the class, I also need to coordinate the corresponding participants, collect the registration forms... In short, I seem to be very busy every day, but busy without meaning, unclear.

In terms of majors, although I have some accumulation of development experience, I know very well that my technology is actually very poor (especially under the contrast of [rene](https://rene.wang)), and I still know my own weight. To my surprise, when participating in various college-level and school-level competitions, the performance of my projects was unexpectedly good. In the college maker competition that just ended a few days ago, there were a total of six promotion places, and the three projects I participated in were all among them, and I was a little proud at that time. (I have to make a small complaint about the first prize digital media work, which is purely because all the judges are from digital media)

But the corresponding technical implementation is actually very simple, and each project is the kind that looks very awesome but actually the technology is very simple. The two AI projects are simply making a front-end official website to make it look very formal; the back-end processing almost relies on the Baidu Qianfan API and StableDiffusion, which is just a matter of making an interface and preprocessing. Unfortunately, the entire Department of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data was completely wiped out in the school competition.

## YGeeker: Setting Sail

The work rhythm of YGeeker after the college entrance examination is obviously very tight (especially referring to our CEO, I feel that he is going to work to death every day). With Rene's efforts, YGeeker has released several new products such as 'I Didn't', 'ClipMemo', 'Balloner', and started to build and decorate the [YGeeker official website](https://ygeeker.com) from scratch.

After a month-long preparation, we also released our peripheral products recently. Thanks to the support of all our spiritual shareholders, our first 24-hour sales reached 150+ðŸ’°; also thanks to the spiritual shareholders who did not use the coupons, so that this wave of promotion did not lose money. Frankly speaking, our peripheral products were not originally for the purpose of making a profit, but to play a role in brand promotion, promoting the design style of YGeeker and expressing the love for YGeeker.

Thanks to Rene's exquisite design, every software and hardware product of ours is very beautiful, creating a unique design with the "YGeeker style".
In the future, we plan to complete the company's registration process before the Spring Festival. This is both prompted by the adjustment of relevant policies and our will. Working together requires a sense of ceremony.

## Message: Look at Yourself Who Is Not So Perfect

The best university is in the longing of high school, and the best high school is in the memories of university. After thinking about it, I still intend to write a paragraph to my younger schoolmates and young student developers.

I mentioned at the beginning of the article that I didn't focus too much energy on academic learning during high school, but I don't regret it because I was doing what I liked to do and it was meaningful. But what I want to emphasize is that the premise of not regretting may be that the things you like to do are meaningful and can bring certain help to your future.

I can do this because the things I like happen to be meaningful and can help my future. When I sacrificed a certain amount of academic learning, I had my own future direction in my heart, and I understood that the "amount of sacrifice" had little impact on my future direction, and the return from these "sacrifices" could pave the way for my future.

So what am I trying to say? If you are still confused about your future and don't know where you are going, then please honestly focus on your academic learning, because this is the most helpful thing for you so far.

In addition, don't lose the poetry and the distance. In the three years of junior high school, I lost all the poetry and the distance, completely isolated from the outside world, just forced to study under high pressure. So that it was many years later that I realized that I had missed the summer of 2018, which the whole network called "the most beautiful summer", and missed the "life" of the three years of junior high school, and just lived numbly. So that today I want to invite my younger self to a grand banquet, but I am already powerless. After all, time never comes back.

The college entrance examination was everything at that time, but not the whole of life. In my opinion, everything that happens is the best arrangement. Therefore, in the midst of heavy studies, don't forget to stop and look at life, look at the world, and look at yourself who is not so perfect but still so beautiful.

No matter what the present is like, we can still be brilliant in the future.
