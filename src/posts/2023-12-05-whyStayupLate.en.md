"Those who don't sleep at night, more or less have something to evade or conceal during the day. The knots that cannot be untied during the day are slowly consumed in the night. ——Raymond Carver, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"

A friend asked me: Why do you choose to stay up late instead of getting up early? I replied: I don't know either. If I don't stay up late, I feel like I've lost a few hours of my life.

Yes, why do we stay up late?

The tranquility of the night is like a mirror, giving us the opportunity to face the depths of our hearts and reconnect with ourselves. In the darkness, we have the opportunity to think about our dreams and goals, reflect on past experiences, or explore new ideas and creativity. The peace of the night provides us with a unique thinking environment. Without the hustle and bustle and distractions of the day, we can more focusedly immerse ourselves in our inner world.
If we don't stay up late, our lives will be seamlessly connected. Morning is the beginning of the day, but not the beginning of life. Everyone will have new things to do in the new day, but most of them are not for themselves. When the sun rises, we start to work for a living, rather than enjoying our own lives. If we go to bed early tonight, as soon as we open our eyes tomorrow, it will be time that does not belong to us again.

Whenever the sun sets, it seems that we start to live for ourselves. Suppose we have a complete "Labor Law" and we can leave our work behind after get off work and live entirely for ourselves. At this time, the setting sun begins to be related to us. The length of our day seems to depend on "how late we stay up tonight". The night we stay up is actually a brief freedom. Of course, I know that staying up late is not good for health, and I don't want to stay up late on purpose. I just want to make this brief freedom last a little longer.
Staying up late has become a habit, just like smoking and drinking. We know it's bad for our health, but we still can't help it. We all know that staying up 

late will make us lack energy during the day and even affect our life and work. However, we still choose to stay up late because we want to escape everything during the day.

During the day, we may face various pressures and troubles. Work pressure, study pressure, interpersonal relationship pressure, and even life pressure. These pressures make us feel suffocated, as if there is no end. And staying up late has become a way to escape.

In the darkness of the night, we seem to have found a world of our own. This world has no noise and chaos of the day, only ourselves and the dialogue with our hearts. We can listen to a song quietly, watch a movie, or read a book. These things make us feel relaxed and happy, allowing us to temporarily forget the troubles of the day.

Staying up late can bring us some brief freedom and relaxation, but we should also pay attention to maintaining the health and balance of our body and mind. When pursuing the freedom and solitude of the night, we should also arrange our schedule reasonably and focus on getting enough rest and sleep. Only on the basis of physical and mental health can we better face the challenges of the day and pursue our dreams. Let us find our own peace and strength in the darkness of the night and inject more passion and meaning into our daytime life.
