I just returned to my dorm today, and suddenly, I felt like crying.

It’s been a year since I started college, and during this year, I bought many devices that I was particularly fond of in high school. Some were sold, and some I still keep. But looking at them, I feel an inexplicable urge to cry.

Back in high school, they were perfect in my eyes because I couldn’t afford them, so I could only learn about them on Coolapk and Bilibili. Occasionally, I’d buy a cheap device, only to sell it after a short while. Of course, they were really great back then: iOS was still smooth without unnecessary features; Honor and Huawei hadn’t split yet, and Huawei’s marketing hadn’t changed, so I was still a fan; Meizu was always the best niche product in my mind; Mac was a life goal (too expensive); I hoped that one day, I could collect all the devices I liked…

But now, ever since iOS development was handed over to the guys in India, it’s been getting worse and worse. It’s hard not to sigh as it’s going downhill—frequent lags, overheating, crashes, and a strong whiff of curry; Huawei’s image in my mind has gone from one extreme to another, and I no longer feel inclined to use domestic Android devices because of their unique added features; Meizu 20 has shown me why “those who criticize Meizu are the true fans”—the overheating and power consumption are truly on par with Apple; the delicate and compact Sony XZ2C and iPhone 4S just sit there, occasionally fiddled with, not used but too cherished to sell…

Back then, it was at its best, and now, I’m at my best, but in the end, we will never be at our best together.

A tribute to the bygone years of the digital world.

Congratulations, kid, you’ve finally got what you’ve always wanted.
